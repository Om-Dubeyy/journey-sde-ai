# Calculator App

## 📋 Project Overview

A simple yet functional calculator application built in Python as part of Week 1 of my Software Development Engineer (SDE) journey. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including functions, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero protection
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean terminal-based interaction
- **Input Validation**: Ensures proper user input

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Environment**: Terminal/Command Line

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of terminal/command line

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Om-Dubeyy/journey-sde-ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd journey-sde-ai/projects/Week\ 1/
   ```

3. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Select an operation from the menu
3. Enter the required numbers
4. View the calculated result
5. Choose to perform another calculation or exit

## 📝 Code Structure

```python
# Main functions
add(a, b)       # Addition operation
subtract(a, b)  # Subtraction operation
multiply(a, b)  # Multiplication operation
divide(a, b)    # Division operation with zero-check
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understanding Python functions and return values
- Implementing user input handling
- Error handling and validation
- Code organization and documentation
- Version control with Git

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Currently supports only two operands at a time
- Limited to basic arithmetic operations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for advanced operations (power, square root, etc.)
- [ ] Implement calculation history
- [ ] Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
- [ ] Support for multiple operands
- [ ] Add unit tests

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Proper function design and modularity
- Importance of error handling
- User experience considerations in CLI applications
- Git workflow and commit practices
